## Hi there 👋

I'm **Dongweon Shin (신동원)** — an ophthalmology researcher and developer passionate about combining **clinical insight, data science, and reproducible research**.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:**  
  Machine-learning models for **cataract surgery phase detection**, **dry-eye epidemiology** in ophthalmology.

- 🌱 **Currently learning:**  
  Bayesian statistics, Bioconductor workflows, and interactive apps with Database.

- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:**  
  Open-source ophthalmic imaging tools, surgical video annotation, and academic reproducibility projects (e.g., Quarto, Bioconductor, or Carpentries training).

- 🤔 **Looking for help with:**  
  Expanding clinical AI pipelines and integrating ophthalmology datasets into open-science frameworks.

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  Ophthalmic imaging, KNHANES data analysis, Bayesian modeling, or how to build reproducible R / Python research pipelines.

- 📫 **How to reach me:**
